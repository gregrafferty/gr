I am a professional front end web developer with a passion for building user focused web sites and systems. My main areas of expertise are HTML, CSS and JavaScript although I am not averse to getting involved with the back end code where required and I am familiar with building sites in .Net MVC with C#.

I’ve worked on sites for a number of major brands including Scholl and Durex although the majority of my time recently has been taken up with intranet web applications where I have been responsible for design and user experience as well as writing the front end code. I am highly adaptable, and have benefitted from working in an Agile environment for much of my career by being exposed to a number of development technologies.

Most of what I build is designed to work across a range of devices.

I occasionally undertake small projects outside of my job to keep myself up to date with the latest web technologies and to get more of my work out there.

I am a competent Photoshop user and can quickly learn new software packages where required.

For coding I tend to use  Visual Studio or Adobe Brackets depending on the type of project I’m working on.

My second passion is photography and when I’m not in front of a computer there’s a good chance you’ll find my outside with my camera trying to find my next photograph.

My photography knowledge has been called upon a number of times in my job. This has been as a portrait, product and stock

I’ve built this site to showcase both my passions
